Wizards like to associate with the strong - and this introduction will give them a sense you are someone they should work with. \n\nPrepare an industry analysis and focus on selling the concept of your product, rather than going into details about your product. Wizards tend to like discussing concepts rather than be bogged down by details. Occasionally, they do ask for details, but it is usually so that they can do their own analysis. Be prepared to be challenged, and explain with logical reason why your product is preferred.""",

Don't focus on trying to sell from the start - rather make effort to connect by being genuinely interested in them. \n\nShow sincerity in your interest.Share your personal belief in the product you are selling and communicate the passion you have for the product. Even though your passion may be different from theirs, they enjoy seeing someone who is deeply certain about what they stand for. If it is relevant, talk about your product elevants the mental, emotional and spiritual well-being of others - Healers, as their name suggests, want to see the world become better and humanity lifted up.""",

They're most open to you when things are light and easy. \n\nDuring the pitch, keep it short and keep them engaged by having a dialogue. Explorers tend to disengage quickly if they are asked to just sit down and listen to a presentation.  \n\nIf possible, make the presentation appealing to all the five senses - when they experience a product or service and they like it, nothing much else has to be said. \n\nThey are already likely to buy.""",
    "Sentinel""": "You should take a straightforward, direct approach when engaging the Knights. \n\nSet the agenda from the start and share about your years of experience in the industry and any certifications you have from authoritative bodies.Be prepared and organized with the facts - Knights often request for details of the product and they would like to compare your product to other similar products as well so that they know they're getting the best value for money. \n\nTo support the value of your product, remember to back up your pitch with statistics, hard data and real life testimonials."""
